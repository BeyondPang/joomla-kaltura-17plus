This is the upgraded kaltura plugin for Joomla.
It is the same plugin as was for 1.5, but should work for versions 1.7 - 2.5
Thank you to Steven (spyfly032003) for initiating, and supporting this.

Enjoy,

There are two branches: One for Kaltura CE4 and one for Kaltura CE5.
The only difference between these two are the used UIconf id's.

To install, simply checkout the GIT repository, and zip the 3 different directories (component,content,editors-xtd) idividually.
Then install in Joomla as youre used to.

Enjoy! (themmai on kaltura.org)
